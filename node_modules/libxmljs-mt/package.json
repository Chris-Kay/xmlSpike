Specifically the [desired feature](https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs/issues?labels=desired+feature&page=1&state=open) ones.\n\n### Requirements\n\nMake sure you have met the requirements for [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp#installation). You *do not* need to manually install node-gyp; it comes bundled with node.\n\n",
